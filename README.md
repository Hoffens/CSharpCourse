# CSharpCourse

These are my notes for a course [(link)](https://www.udemy.com/course/programando-en-csharp-de-principiante-a-profesional) that I'm currently taking to reinforce my knowledge of C# and learn new concepts I may have missed or misunderstood. \

# Purpose

    1. To track my progress and help me stay consistent with my studies.
    2. To store all the code for later review and refreshing my knowledge.
    3. Add activity to my github :D
